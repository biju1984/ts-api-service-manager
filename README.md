# Advanced Typescript by Example: API Service Manager

### This repository coincides with a walkthrough available to read on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@rossbulat/advanced-typescript-by-example-api-service-manager-7ea591f5eba8).

The purpose of an API manager is to handle a web service, from its authentication to making requests and handling responses -  that will either generate a successful result or a failure.

The manager must ensure type safety along the way; it is fully typed, as are the request and response objects you expect to receive.

To prevent re-inventing the wheel, requests are sent via Javascript's native `fetch()` API, that works hand-in-hand with the manager.
